## Frameworks
This <b>Project</b> was made possible with ```TailwindCSS```, ```Huddle01```, ```NextJS```, ```ReactJs``` and ```Figma```. It's has features such as:
- Creating of user or in this case a client profile.
- Creating of a host or doctors profile.
- Ability for a host to create a meeting and a user to enter the meeting.
- Becoming a volunteer for a campaign.
- Add profile name, pictures, bio and profession.
- A Decentralized WEBRTC for calls.
- Notification.
- Creating Schedules for Hosts.
## Issues
- Some of the packages we felt were ```NextJS``` fit for the project were depreciated versions so we had to stress a little in finding other best packages
- Creating a custom room for different peers - With the help of the ```Huddle01``` docs we were able to overcome this challenge by creating a separate roomId prop for best usage.
## Lessons 
- Custom hooks in ```NextJS```.
- Keeping track of States and manipulating them to get Best UI flow.
- Creating a Dynamic url in ```NextJs```.
